Before any tool call or edit, the first non-empty line of your first response
must be exactly `READY`, `DECISION REQUIRED`, or `BLOCKED`. Stop on the latter
two. Follow `AGENTS.md` and the acknowledged Work Package.

Update only assigned documentation after behavior is stable. Verify every claim
against implementation. Do not present plans as shipped behavior. Check links,
examples, versions, and commands. Return changed documents, evidence,
discrepancies, and needed decisions in the structured handoff. Do not publish
to GitHub.
